#### Why does CLI client immediately crashes first time I try to run it?
The CLI client is unable to run on its own, i.e. without being connected to the witness node (via a web socket connection). So to successfully run the CLI client you need to do this:
* make sure you have this entry uncommented in the `witness_node_data_dir/config.ini` file  
`rpc-endpoint = 127.0.0.1:8090`
* before you start the CLI client, you need to start the witness node (and wait a while till it's up and running)

#### How do I check whether the witness node is already synced?
Run the `info` command in the CLI client and check the `head_block_age` value.

---
#### I have problems with syncing the witness node - it seems to be unable to sync beyond a certain date. Is it common that this task fails? Shall I keep trying to sync it?
You should always make sure you use the newest build available [here](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-2/releases/latest) as earlier releases will get stuck due to hard-forks.

#### What is the best way to interact with the witness node? It does not have an inbuilt CLI so there seems to be no way to control it, apart from opening & closing it.
The only way you can interact with the witness node is through the CLI client by using its API.  
You can also use the GUI (i.e. the light client). In the GUI, change `Settings -> API connection`, add `ws://127.0.0.1:8090/ws` (according to settings of your witness node) and select it.

#### In the [pre-compiled version](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-2/releases), in the `config.ini` file for the wintess node I have this line uncommented by default: `private-key = ["BTS6MRyAjQ..","5KQwrPbwdL.."]`. Whose private key is this? Why is it predefined in this way? Can I safely comment it out?
It's a shared key for some special purpose. But I don't remember what it is. If I remember BM or someone else has ever explained it in the forum, but I can't find the post right now. Just let it be there. I think if you comment it out, it will appear again automatically, it's generated by the code of witness_node.

#### What is the meaning of all those different text colors in the witness node console? I can see messages displaying in white, green & dark yellow.
green - debug  
white - info/default  
yellow/brown - warning  
red - error  
blue - some kind of info, I don't know  
Related source files are in `libraries/fc/include/fc/log/` and `libraries/fc/src/log/`.

#### What is the difference between public and private testnet as described [here](http://docs.bitshares.eu/testnet/index.html)?
Not much. The biggest difference is that public testnet are intended for wider audience.

---
#### How can I close the witness node in a clean way?
In windows use `ctrl-c`.

---
#### How can I close the CLI client in a clean way?
There seems to be no command for that (something like "exit" or "quit").  
In Windows closing the whole window produces a nasty exception.  
In Windows you can try `ctrl-d` which stops the process but stil produces a nasty exception.

---
#### Regarding the witness node, is it safe to delete logs stored in `witness_node_data_dir\logs\p2p`?
Yes, but  
-- they're rotated automatically after 24 hours anyway  
-- if you don't use them you should probably modify `config.ini` so they aren't written to disk in the first place.

####  How can I import to my CLI client a wallet originally created in the web GUI? I would expect something like "restore_backup" command that would accept a *.bin wallet file.
CLI and WEB wallet are two separated applications. They use separated ways to represent backups. I think you can currently only manually import keys from the GUI into the CLI.

---
#### I'd like to create and register a new account in my CLI wallet and pay for the registration from an existing account in the web GUI. How do I do this?
It doesn't work that way with the current implementation.  
But you can work around it by importing an active key of a **Lifetime Member** account that has funds:

1. In the gui, go to the permissions tab of an account that is funded and has a LTM status.
2. Click on the BTS public key on the ACTIVE tab and copy the private key.
3. In the cli-wallet run:  
`import_key <account_name> <private_key>`
4. Then run:  
`suggest_brain_key`  
and copy the brain key. (You might want to make a backup of your brain key somewhere.)
5. Create a new account with this command:  
`create_account_with_brain_key <brainkey> <new_account_name> <imported_name> <imported_name> true`

This will create a new account called `<new_account_name>` and set the registrar and referrer to `<imported_name>`.
The brainkey can be used to regenerate the account (even in the GUI wallet).  
You can manually delete the other active key from the `wallet.json` file.
