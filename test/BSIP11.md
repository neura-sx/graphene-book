# Abstract
Currently the Annual Membership (AM) price is set globally by the Committee and there is a 20% cut reserved for the network. The remaining 80% goes to the registrar and the referrer (the split between them is defined by the registrar).

This arragment is not flexible. A registrar, operating on a market which requires very low tranfer fees, is limited to the minimum price required by the network. The purpose of this proposal is to remove this limitation and allow a registrar to offer AM for any price she wants, provided that 20% of her income from AM sale is allocated to the network.

What is proposed is a very simple change: the price of AM to be dteremined not globally by the commitee but locally by the regional registrars. In regions requiring low fees, AM given away for free (or almost for free) translates into low transfer fees, as 80% discount is awarded automaticlly to all AM holders.

# Motivation
The primary motivation of this proposal is to allow BitShares to be competitve on markets which might require very low transfer fees, while taking care of these two important aspects:
* keep the default transfer fee at the current level, which is high enough to support the referral program, as it was initially annaoucned in June 2014.
* preserve network's income from AM sales


# Rationale
By allowing the AM to be flexibley deteremined locally be a registrar, effective transfer fee can be reduced by 80% by selling AM at a very low price or giving it away for free to all newly registered accounts.


# Specifications


# Discussion
This is the most crucial question: if the price of AM has no lower limit, how can the network's income be preserved? 

If there was a perfect competiotion between hostet wallet services (or generally all registrars) there could be a problem with that, as the price of AM would be constantly undermined by new market particppants. However it will take a long time for the BitShares ecosystem to reach this state and when this state is reached there will be no need to for the referral program anyway.
