# Approving a proposed transfer
### Prerequisites
* We assume that you have `cli_wallet` running and connected to an exiting witness node.

* We assume that you have set up a wallet in the CLI and imported a private key of an account with some BTS funds in it. We will refer to this account as `your-base-account`.

* We assume that you have already created and broadcast a proposed transfer awaiting to be approved by two accounts, whose private keys you control. We will refer to these accounts as `approving-account-1` and `approving-account-2`.
